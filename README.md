## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I used the display grid property for the first time. This helped me much in the transition from mobile layout to desktop layout. 

### Continued development

In the next challenges I look forward to using the display grid property since the beginning, and see how it goes. I still think the display flex property has to be used at some point, but I should force myself to only use display grid and experience it.

### Useful resources

- [w3school.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid_container.asp) - This helped me learn the display grid property and how to configure it.
